# mechapy
A toolbox for engineers that intuitively ties together an OO framework for all things mechanical, e.g.,
materials, sections, components, systems, etc., leveraging the litany of tables that engineers continue
to reference in the appendices of hard cover books. There is a better way!

Not a mere pile of functions to compute common equations, mechapy strives to be more than this.

Importantly, units are a fundamental, non-trivial aspect of accurate engineering. To that end, this project
leverages 'pint', which is one of the most robust solutions to this problem available in the python ecosystem.

```python
>>> from mechapy import Steel,
>>> steel = mech.Steel
>>>


```
